<h1>Background / Purpose</h1>
<p>We have built the class around a set of data driven projects. During
each of those projects we will cover readings in visualzation, data
handling, and statistics. Excluding the first two days and the last two
days of class, we will spend four days of class on each case study. You
can find <a href="data.html">data for each project on the data
page</a></p>

<p>Data intuition and insight is not rocket science. However, there is a
science to data handling, visualization, and decision making with data.
The material we cover this semester will introduce to topics around this
science.</p>

<h1>Case Study 2: Lego my data</h1>
<div id="background-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Lego has become one of the <a
href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/1/29/18202463/lego-resale-market-high-return-rate?__c=1">most
valuable toys on the planet</a>. You can even download software and
create your own sets from bulk toys (<a
href="https://www.leocad.org/index.html">https://www.leocad.org/index.html</a>).</p>
<p>We will be selling bulk LEGO in 1-lb bags. According to this <a
href="https://bricks.stackexchange.com/questions/9716/how-to-sell-a-large-amount-of-lego">LEGO
selling guide</a>, the more organized the bricks are the better they
will sell. While most Ebayers take a couple of photos and list the
number of pounds to sell their project, we will be selling our bags of
LEGO with data visualizations. If you would like more details about each
brick you can <a

</div>
<div id="your-challenge-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Your Challenge</h2>
<p>You will need to work with your team to enter your LEGO data and then
create a set of visualizations that sell your product. We will need to
prepare our sales material to make sure we can communicate our bag of
LEGO without them handling or seeing the product (no pictures of your
bag of LEGO).</p>
<p>With your team, record information for each LEGO brick in your bag
(such as color). Then create data visualizations to answer questions you
think the buyers might have. Some example questions are listed
below.</p>
<ul>
<li>How many slanted bricks do you have?</li>
<li>What is the distribution of colors available in your set?</li>
<li>What is the total area by color?</li>

class="section level1">
<h1>Case Study 3: What is normal about marathons?</h1>
<div id="background-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In a nod to Greek history, the first marathon in 1896 commemorated
the run of the soldier Pheidippides from a battlefield near the town of
Marathon, Greece, to Athens in 490 B.C. For the 1908 London Olympics,
the course was laid out from Windsor Castle to White City stadium, about
26 miles. An extra 385 yards was added inside the stadium to locate the
finish line in front of the royal family’s viewing box.</p>
<p>Despite the success of that first race, it took 13 more years of
arguing before the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF)
adopted the 1908 distance as the official marathon. Today, there are
more than 500 organized marathons in 64 countries around the world each
year, with more than 425,000 marathon finishers in the United States
alone (reference).</p>
<p>Eric J. Allen published an article on marathon runners and they have
shared much of the data that we will use. We have formatted their data
and its size for use in our class. Their data has close to 10 million
observations.</p>
</div>
<div id="your-challenge-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Your Challenge</h2>
<p>You will need to work with your team to describe the finishing times
and how they relate to the associated spatial and temporal information
about the marathon. You will look at the individual marathon runners and
the marathon’s themselves. You have been asked to create a short story
that describes marathons that could be published in a local newspaper
the week before a marathon is to be held in their community.</p>
<p>You can find varied data sources available for your use on the data
page in Canvas. You will need to use more than one of the data sets
provided but you are not expected to use them all.</p>
</div>
<div id="deliverables-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A short article with less than 500 words and 4-6
visualizations.</li>
<li>Your article should introduce the reader to what a normal
distribution is with the use of a visualization of the marathon
data.</li>
<li>Your article should contain at least one spatial, temporal, and
variable graphic.</li>
<li>Your article should contain one table that provides data
summaries.</li>
<li>The end of your article should contain one quote from a reader (like
a comment on the article). The reader should be a spouse, parent, or

<h1>Case Study 4: What is a healthy child?</h1>
<div id="background-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Do you remember you or your sibling going to the doctor for a
check-up to hear a conversation about what percentile the measured
height and weight were in? The World Health Organization gets some bad
press at times of pandemics, but they do much more than managing
pandemics. With the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC),
they define the standards for those percentiles that you hear - <a

</div>
<div id="your-challenge-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Your Challenge</h2>
<p>We have repeated measurements of weights and heights for children
from varied multiple countries (United States, Netherlands, Bangladesh,
Brazil, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, South Africa, and Tanzania). We
will use these measures to explain the health of the children in each
study location and to explore children that have poor health over most
of their measurements (note: subjects were part of a study of specific
groups and are not representative of the country).</p>

<div id="deliverables-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<p>A short presentation (4-8 slides) that visualizes child health using
the height measurements. Each presentation should include the following.
Remember to find a story and weave your charts together into one
cohesive story.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>One slide should explain what a z-score is and how it is calculated
for our graphics.</li>
<li>One slide should show height adjusted z-scores (HAZ) for a few
healthy and a few unhealthy children from each gender over all the times
using the MAL-ED data.</li>
<li>1-2 Slides about the health of the children at 365 days (1-year) for
multiple countries.
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>One chart should show the distribution of heights for children from
at least 4 countries at ~365 days.</li>
<li>One chart should have visualizations of the health of the children
at ~365 days for each country (height adjusted z-scores).</li>
<li>Take the time to explain your concerns about the health of the
children of the study based on their z-scores.</li>

<h1>Case Study 5: Does your birthday make you better at sports?</h1>
<div id="background-4" class="section level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Matthew 25:29 explains that _‘whoever has will be given more, and
they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have
will be taken from them’ _which has lead many researchers to describe
how some get more and others get less as the<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">‘Matthew Effect’</a>
in our society.</p>
<p>One way to evaluate this effect is to look at professional athletes.
Malcolm Gladwell studies the birth dates of successful hockey players in
a chapter of his 2008 non-fiction book Outliers to provide an example of
the Matthew Effect. Please read the <a
href="https://byuistats.github.io/CSE150/files/matthew_effect_gladwell.pdf">Matthew
Effect chapter</a> to get more background.</p>
<p>Hockey’s cutoff date is December 31st, but baseball’s cutoff date has
historically been <a

Football’s cutoff is <a
href="https://www.americanyouthfootball.com/football/">July 31st</a> as
well but they also have weight categories as well for older ages.
Basketball’s AAU cutoff date is <a

31st</a>.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Up to this point in our course, we have been protecting you against
the difficulty of gathering and formatting data for use in visualization

data. Some business analysts will stay in Excel and use VBA or use DAX
in PowerBI. We are still going to protect you, but you will have to
guide us on your data needs.</p>
<p>Most of the time data scientists move to the programming languages of
Python, R, or SQL to wrangle their data. Both PowerBI and Tableau allow
all three languages to be used internally.</p>

<h1>Case Study 8: Do you want to be a data scientist?</h1>
<div id="background-7" class="section level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Data scientists need to have resumes that show strong experience in
solving real-world problems. While employers know that their job
candidates need experience, they often don’t know what experience they
need and often list too many requirements.</p>
</div>
<div id="your-challenge-7" class="section level2">
<h2>Your Challenge</h2>
<p>To finish the semester you will need to create your hypothetical
resume that you could use upon graduation from BYU-I to a data science
or analytics position. Your resume will need to combine the three
elements of coursework available, the real-work experience you can
accumulate over your next few years before graduation, and the job
requirements of the currently available positions for undergraduate data
scientists.</p>

<li>A one-page dream data science resume.</li>
<li>A second page of sources that you used to justify the stuff in your
resume.</li>

course</li>
