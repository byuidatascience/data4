    "text": "3.1 Background\nIn a nod to Greek history, the first marathon in 1896 commemorated the run of the soldier Pheidippides from a battlefield near the town of Marathon, Greece, to Athens in 490 B.C. For the 1908 London Olympics, the course was laid out from Windsor Castle to White City stadium, about 26 miles. An extra 385 yards was added inside the stadium to locate the finish line in front of the royal family’s viewing box.\nDespite the success of that first race, it took 13 more years of arguing before the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) adopted the 1908 distance as the official marathon. Today, there are more than 500 organized marathons in 64 countries around the world each year, with more than 425,000 marathon finishers in the United States alone (reference).\nEric J. Allen published an article on marathon runners and they have shared much of the data that we will use. We have formatted their data and its size for use in our class. Their data has close to 10 million observations."

Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them’ _which has lead many researchers to describe how some get more and others get less as the‘Matthew Effect’ in our society.\nOne way to evaluate this effect is to look at professional athletes. Malcolm Gladwell studies the birth dates of successful hockey players in a chapter of his 2008 non-fiction book Outliers to provide an example of the Matthew Effect. Please read the Matthew Effect chapter to get more background.\nHockey’s cutoff date is December 31st, but baseball’s cutoff date has historically been July 31st.
